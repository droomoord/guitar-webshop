**The Guitar King** webshop is a fictional webshop that I built for educational purposes. It uses PHP, VUE and Strapi as a CMS.

note: the check-out button doesn't work yet.

It is hosted at [https://guitar-webshop.herokuapp.com/](https://guitar-webshop.herokuapp.com/), but since I'm using Heroku's free dynos it takes some time to load.
